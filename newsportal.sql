And with good reason -- despite officials\' daily insistence that Johnson was in \"good spirits,\" Johnson himself has since admitted that his life was in the balance.\r\n\r\nQuestions over whether Downing Street was fully transparent about the Prime Minister\'s health will doubtless dominate the British media in the days to come. But while important, they risk overshadowing the true picture of the UK\'s struggle against coronavirus.\r\n\r\n\r\nJeremy Farrar, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), put it starkly when he told the BBC\'s Andrew Marr program on Sunday that the UK is \"likely to be one of the worst, if not the worst, affected countries in Europe\".\r\nOnly a few weeks ago, Britons looked on at the unfolding horror in Italy and Spain. Now, as those two countries appear to be over the worst, the UK is on a similar, grim trajectory. The British government -- led by Johnson\'s designated deputy, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab -- is facing serious questions about why.\r\nSome health experts are increasingly scathing about the government\'s response to the crisis -- driven largely by the advice of leading scientists from SAGE.\r\nGabriel Scally, president of epidemiology and public health at the Royal Society of Medicine, believes this has led to an abstract response -- one based on numbers and scientific models -- rather than traditional principles of public health.\r\n\"There has been this kind of scientism -- an approach of academics gathering data and analyzing it then producing theories to be tested -- at the heart of the government\'s response,\" he says. \"In fact, what we needed was to follow good public health practice and listen to the advice from the World Health Organization.\"\r\n\r\n   In the early stages of the pandemic, the UK was something of an outlier compared to its European counterparts, especially in the areas of testing and social distancing measures. Unlike some other states, the UK appeared slow to increase its testing capacity, and reluctant to impose the kind of social distancing measures that were swiftly put in place elsewhere. \"I find it amazing that testing, contact tracing and isolation was not part of any of the scenarios that any of the expert advisers on this group discussed,\" Scally says.\r\nIt has been barely a week since the UK announced plans to increase its testing capacity to 100,000 by the end of April, after even Johnson loyalists criticized the UK\'s approach to testing compared to countries like Germany. As of Monday morning, the most recent number was 18,000 tests in a 24-hour period, according to the government.\r\n\"I don\'t see how we are going to reach 100,000 tests a day unless we dramatically increase testing capacity,\" says Simon Clarke, associate professor in microbiology at the UK\'s University of Reading. \"It\'s also worth noting that other countries will also want to increase their capacity, so this is going to place a massive burden on companies producing testing kits.\"\r\nTesting hasn\'t been the only area in which the UK\'s coronavirus strategy has been criticized.\r\nFor weeks, the government has insisted that its primary objective has been to minimize pressure on the National Health Service. That has meant encouraging people to go home and self-isolate if they show symptoms of coronavirus, and only seek medical care if those symptoms persist. It has also reluctantly introduced social distancing measures in order to spread the peak of the crisis over a longer period of time, meaning that hospitals are not overwhelmed at once.\r\nThere are signs that this approach has -- albeit belatedly -- begun to work.\r\nWhile some claim that the government\'s predictions for the peak dates of the outbreak have shifted in recent weeks, Clarke says that \"the peak is not really a peak, the peak is a plateau and I don\'t think it has actually shifted.\"\r\nThis fits with Johnson\'s previously stated aim to \"squash the sombrero\" of the outbreak, delaying hospital admissions over a longer period of time in order to manage the pressure on the health service. \"The peak will last for at least a week, probably closer to two. That\'s why it gives the appearance of being pushed back, but in reality it was always meant to start flattening now,\" adds Clarke.\r\nThe government is keen to point out that it is running a surplus of intensive care beds and ventilators, meaning anyone who needs such treatment has access to it.\r\nBut inside the hospitals battling the outbreak, the picture isn\'t so rosy.\r\nUnions representing doctors, nurses and care workers complain that the level of personal protective equipment (PPE) they need is not hitting the frontline anywhere near fast enough.\r\nOn Monday, the Royal College of Nursing issued guidance that staff were entitled to refuse to work if they did not feel comfortable doing so. \"If the employer does not provide appropriate PPE and a safe working environment, as an employee you can refuse to care for a patient.\"                                                                                                                ', 'Politics', '190723152514-08-boris-johnson-0723-exlarge-169.jpg', 1, '2020-04-13 21:33:21', 1, 20, 1),

Once the man arrived at the Saint-Dizier air base in northeastern France and realized what his co-workers had arranged, he began to feel extremely stressed, according to a fairly remarkable aviation accident report by a French government agency.\r\nThe unnamed man had never expressed any desire to fly in a fighter jet and had no previous military aviation experience, investigators discovered.\r\nAnd thanks to a watch he was wearing which could measure his heart rate, investigators noticed that \"his heart was in full tachycardia\" before the flight, with a recorded heart rate ranging from 136 to 142 beats per minute.\r\nBut the man went through with the ride, joining a three-plane training exercise as a passenger. The Rafale B is used by the French air force, and has a maximum speed of nearly 1,400 kilometers per hour (870 miles per hour).\r\nWhen the jet was 2,500 feet above ground and the pilot began to climb, the passenger panicked and reached for something to hold onto.\r\nUnfortunately, that something was the ejector seat button -- and the 64-year-old flew from the fighter jet.\r\nTo make matters worse, he had not securely attached his helmet, which went flying in midair.\r\nFortunately, the man avoided seriously injury after tumbling to earth in a field near the German border.\r\nInvestigators concluded that the error was caused by an involuntary reflex, prompted by stress and the jet\'s sudden movement.\r\nThe pilot was not ejected and managed to land the plane safely, despite suffering some minor facial injuries during the ordeal.\r\nThe passenger, meanwhile, was taken to a nearby hospital after the flight.', 'General', 'http___cdn.cnn.com_cnnnext_dam_assets_200413151653-01-france-ejection-investigation.jpg', 0, '2020-04-13 21:40:25', 0, 20, 1),

But these \"rice ATMs\" have been set up around Vietnam to help those who need it most during the coronavirus pandemic.\r\n\r\nVietnam has 265 cases of the novel coronavirus and zero deaths, numbers that are significantly lower than the rest of the world. But still, to prevent further spread, the government has enforced social distancing, effectively shutting down many small businesses and leaving thousands out of work.\r\nFor these people who are suddenly without income, businessmen and donors have set up machines that dispense free rice at several cities across Vietnam.\r\nIn Hanoi, rice contained in a large water tank pours out into residents\' bags from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. each day, according to state-run news agency VNA.\r\nThose waiting in line are required to stand six feet apart from each other and they must use hand sanitizer before receiving their rice, according to local newspaper Hanoi Times.\r\nIn the central city of Hue, a rice ATM located at a college provides 2 kilograms (4.4 pounds) of free rice for local residents.\r\nIn Ho Chi Minh City, a rice ATM dispenses rice 24/7. And in Da Nang, two rice ATMs will be set up next week, according to VNA.

(9, '  Trump\'s favorite scapegoat emerges as his best ally in US economic rescue effort  ', '                                                                President Donald Trump\'s closest ally in the fight to stave off the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression is the same man he\'s pilloried for years: Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.\r\n\r\nThe world\'s most powerful central bank has done more, faster, than any central bank in history as the Covid-19 pandemic has ravaged the US economy, leaving tens of thousands of small businesses on the precipice of implosion and creating a cascade of job losses totaling in the millions each week.\r\nUnder Powell -- a former investment banker appointed by Trump, who has since suggested he regretted the choice -- the Fed has pushed the boundaries of actions and power to a degree that was considered exceedingly difficult, unlikely or impossible as recently as the 2008 financial crisis.\r\n\"It really is impressive the speed with which they move,\" David Wessel, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution and the author of the definitive history of the Fed\'s actions during the 2008 crisis. \"They are doing things in days and weeks that it took them months to do during \'07, \'08 and \'09.\"\r\nThe latest blast, announced this past week, would provide up to $2.3 trillion in lending programs for companies, cities and states, a move that extended the scale Fed\'s efforts to a place they had simply never been before.\r\nPowell, in a conversation with Wessel on Thursday after the rollout of the latest lending bazooka, framed the action -- and everything the Fed has done -- as an effort to match the moment with commensurate action.\r\n\"None of us has the luxury of choosing our challenges; fate and history provide them for us. Our job is to meet the tests we are presented,\" Powell said. \"At the Fed, we are doing all we can to help shepherd the economy through this difficult time.\"\r\nLearning the lessons of 2008\r\nSo far, even the most prominent Fed critics and skeptics have hardly batted an eye at the scale of the moves as the depth of the hit to the economy has been laid bare in recent weeks.\r\nThat\'s in part because of the nature of the current crisis versus the last one. A pandemic is not the same as Wall Street banks using financial instruments to package bad loans at a scale that would threaten the global financial system, or overleveraged borrowers, or companies that made bad decisions or investments.\r\nIt\'s a once-in-a-century event that has led to a freeze of the entire US economy, and as such has placed an enormous weight on the Fed to respond.\r\n\"The Fed\'s overall objective is blindingly simple,\" Tim Duy, professor of practice in the department of economics at the University of Oregon wrote in his newsletter \"Tim Duy\'s Fed Watch.\" \"To not let the financial sector seize up and reverberate back into the real economy. To not repeat the mistakes of the Great Depression. To not let another 15 million people lose their jobs. To hold as much of the economy together as possible to let those newly unemployed return to work as quickly as possible.\"\r\nThe role of the Fed in mitigating the current economic crisis is not without potential pitfalls. The backlash to the central bank in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis was fierce -- and placed it in the crosshairs of lawmakers from both parties for years.\r\nAfter that, efforts to engage with lawmakers and the public were dramatically expanded as Fed officials came to realize the traditional playbook of letting the Fed\'s actions and occasional public statements or congressional testimony speak for itself was not going to address the very real perception issues with the Fed\'s moves.\r\nA Washington operator\r\nPowell has continued, and expanded on, that communications effort since he became chairman in 2017. Lawmakers and aides on Capitol Hill say they\'ve found him accessible and blunt -- and in the words of one senator \"particularly helpful\" in framing the needed response to an unprecedented economic crisis.\r\nIt was Powell, in a March 17 private call with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who made the point that after two back-to-back emergency cuts that took interest rates to nearly zero, Congress was \"enabled to fiscally think big\" as it crafted its emergency economic response to coronavirus, according to a senior Democratic aide familiar with the call. Pelosi urged Powell to explore ways the Fed could aid states and localities during that same call.\r\nBy the time the final emergency rescue package was put together, it was both big -- at $2.2 trillion it marked the largest economic rescue package in US history -- and explicitly directed the Fed to use financial backing to create a facility to aid states and localities.\r\nWhile the Fed\'s economic power is unparalleled, its role in nearly every aspect of the current effort to rescue the economy is striking -- both in direct action or with regulatory moves to assist other elements.
