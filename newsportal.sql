And with good reason -- despite officials\' daily insistence that Johnson was in \"good spirits,\" Johnson himself has since admitted that his life was in the balance.\r\n\r\nQuestions over whether Downing Street was fully transparent about the Prime Minister\'s health will doubtless dominate the British media in the days to come. But while important, they risk overshadowing the true picture of the UK\'s struggle against coronavirus.\r\n\r\n\r\nJeremy Farrar, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), put it starkly when he told the BBC\'s Andrew Marr program on Sunday that the UK is \"likely to be one of the worst, if not the worst, affected countries in Europe\".\r\nOnly a few weeks ago, Britons looked on at the unfolding horror in Italy and Spain. Now, as those two countries appear to be over the worst, the UK is on a similar, grim trajectory. The British government -- led by Johnson\'s designated deputy, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab -- is facing serious questions about why.\r\nSome health experts are increasingly scathing about the government\'s response to the crisis -- driven largely by the advice of leading scientists from SAGE.\r\nGabriel Scally, president of epidemiology and public health at the Royal Society of Medicine, believes this has led to an abstract response -- one based on numbers and scientific models -- rather than traditional principles of public health.\r\n\"There has been this kind of scientism -- an approach of academics gathering data and analyzing it then producing theories to be tested -- at the heart of the government\'s response,\" he says. \"In fact, what we needed was to follow good public health practice and listen to the advice from the World Health Organization.\"\r\n\r\n   In the early stages of the pandemic, the UK was something of an outlier compared to its European counterparts, especially in the areas of testing and social distancing measures. Unlike some other states, the UK appeared slow to increase its testing capacity, and reluctant to impose the kind of social distancing measures that were swiftly put in place elsewhere. \"I find it amazing that testing, contact tracing and isolation was not part of any of the scenarios that any of the expert advisers on this group discussed,\" Scally says.\r\nIt has been barely a week since the UK announced plans to increase its testing capacity to 100,000 by the end of April, after even Johnson loyalists criticized the UK\'s approach to testing compared to countries like Germany. As of Monday morning, the most recent number was 18,000 tests in a 24-hour period, according to the government.\r\n\"I don\'t see how we are going to reach 100,000 tests a day unless we dramatically increase testing capacity,\" says Simon Clarke, associate professor in microbiology at the UK\'s University of Reading. \"It\'s also worth noting that other countries will also want to increase their capacity, so this is going to place a massive burden on companies producing testing kits.\"\r\nTesting hasn\'t been the only area in which the UK\'s coronavirus strategy has been criticized.\r\nFor weeks, the government has insisted that its primary objective has been to minimize pressure on the National Health Service. That has meant encouraging people to go home and self-isolate if they show symptoms of coronavirus, and only seek medical care if those symptoms persist. It has also reluctantly introduced social distancing measures in order to spread the peak of the crisis over a longer period of time, meaning that hospitals are not overwhelmed at once.\r\nThere are signs that this approach has -- albeit belatedly -- begun to work.\r\nWhile some claim that the government\'s predictions for the peak dates of the outbreak have shifted in recent weeks, Clarke says that \"the peak is not really a peak, the peak is a plateau and I don\'t think it has actually shifted.\"\r\nThis fits with Johnson\'s previously stated aim to \"squash the sombrero\" of the outbreak, delaying hospital admissions over a longer period of time in order to manage the pressure on the health service. \"The peak will last for at least a week, probably closer to two. That\'s why it gives the appearance of being pushed back, but in reality it was always meant to start flattening now,\" adds Clarke.\r\nThe government is keen to point out that it is running a surplus of intensive care beds and ventilators, meaning anyone who needs such treatment has access to it.\r\nBut inside the hospitals battling the outbreak, the picture isn\'t so rosy.\r\nUnions representing doctors, nurses and care workers complain that the level of personal protective equipment (PPE) they need is not hitting the frontline anywhere near fast enough.\r\nOn Monday, the Royal College of Nursing issued guidance that staff were entitled to refuse to work if they did not feel comfortable doing so. \"If the employer does not provide appropriate PPE and a safe working environment, as an employee you can refuse to care for a patient.\"                                                                                                                ', 'Politics', '190723152514-08-boris-johnson-0723-exlarge-169.jpg', 1, '2020-04-13 21:33:21', 1, 20, 1, '1'),

Once the man arrived at the Saint-Dizier air base in northeastern France and realized what his co-workers had arranged, he began to feel extremely stressed, according to a fairly remarkable aviation accident report by a French government agency.\r\nThe unnamed man had never expressed any desire to fly in a fighter jet and had no previous military aviation experience, investigators discovered.\r\nAnd thanks to a watch he was wearing which could measure his heart rate, investigators noticed that \"his heart was in full tachycardia\" before the flight, with a recorded heart rate ranging from 136 to 142 beats per minute.\r\nBut the man went through with the ride, joining a three-plane training exercise as a passenger. The Rafale B is used by the French air force, and has a maximum speed of nearly 1,400 kilometers per hour (870 miles per hour).\r\nWhen the jet was 2,500 feet above ground and the pilot began to climb, the passenger panicked and reached for something to hold onto.\r\nUnfortunately, that something was the ejector seat button -- and the 64-year-old flew from the fighter jet.\r\nTo make matters worse, he had not securely attached his helmet, which went flying in midair.\r\nFortunately, the man avoided seriously injury after tumbling to earth in a field near the German border.\r\nInvestigators concluded that the error was caused by an involuntary reflex, prompted by stress and the jet\'s sudden movement.\r\nThe pilot was not ejected and managed to land the plane safely, despite suffering some minor facial injuries during the ordeal.\r\nThe passenger, meanwhile, was taken to a nearby hospital after the flight.', 'General', 'http___cdn.cnn.com_cnnnext_dam_assets_200413151653-01-france-ejection-investigation.jpg', 1, '2020-04-13 21:40:25', 0, 20, 1, '2'),

When the Austin-based festival SXSW was called off due to coronavirus, Mariani was left with an Airbnb bill for more than $1,000.\r\nReacting to customer complaints, the company vastly expanded its coronavirus response on March 13, allowing more travelers to qualify for penalty-free bookings.\r\nNext, it was Airbnb\'s hosts who complained, upset that the company had upended cancellation policies, costing them vital income.\r\nRelated content\r\nAirbnb hosts struggle to pay the bills as the pandemic sparks mass cancellations\r\n\"Extending refunds to practically everyone through April 1, will be absolutely devastating to hosts,\" wrote the short-term vacation rental group purchasing organization Host GPO in an open letter to the company. (The coronavirus cancellation policy has since been extended through the end of May.)\r\nIn an effort to appease and support angry hosts, on March 30th Airbnb unveiled a $250 million Host Relief Fund, plus a $10 million Superhost Relief Fund offering grants of up to $5,000 for qualifying hosts.\r\nAirbnb is getting help, too. On Monday, the company announced a $1 billion investment from the private equity firm Silver Lake and the investment firm Sixth Street Partners.\r\nThese deals, which include an additional $5 million earmark for the Superhost Relief Fund, come at a time when some hosts are noticing the limitations of the aid package.\r\nThe $250 million Host Relief Fund will partially refund hosts for some cancellations, but the money only covers a fraction of their losses. Since refunds are limited to 25 percent of what hosts would have received from a normal cancellation, even those with a strict cancellation policy would recoup just 12.5 percent of the total booking.\r\nAnd the Superhost Relief Fund comes with limitations, too.\r\nHosts cannot apply for the grants directly. Instead, selected hosts will be invited to apply. The qualifications specify that hosts must demonstrate that Airbnb is a vital source of their income, and that they have lost \"a significant percentage of their earnings due to COVID-19.\" (Some hosts have wondered on Twitter how Airbnb will identify hosts for invitations without access to details of their income.)

Our job is to meet the tests we are presented,\" Powell said. \"At the Fed, we are doing all we can to help shepherd the economy through this difficult time.\"\r\nLearning the lessons of 2008\r\nSo far, even the most prominent Fed critics and skeptics have hardly batted an eye at the scale of the moves as the depth of the hit to the economy has been laid bare in recent weeks.\r\nThat\'s in part because of the nature of the current crisis versus the last one. A pandemic is not the same as Wall Street banks using financial instruments to package bad loans at a scale that would threaten the global financial system, or overleveraged borrowers, or companies that made bad decisions or investments.\r\nIt\'s a once-in-a-century event that has led to a freeze of the entire US economy, and as such has placed an enormous weight on the Fed to respond.\r\n\"The Fed\'s overall objective is blindingly simple,\" Tim Duy, professor of practice in the department of economics at the University of Oregon wrote in his newsletter \"Tim Duy\'s Fed Watch.\" \"To not let the financial sector seize up and reverberate back into the real economy. To not repeat the mistakes of the Great Depression. To not let another 15 million people lose their jobs. To hold as much of the economy together as possible to let those newly unemployed return to work as quickly as possible.\"\r\nThe role of the Fed in mitigating the current economic crisis is not without potential pitfalls. The backlash to the central bank in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis was fierce -- and placed it in the crosshairs of lawmakers from both parties for years.\r\nAfter that, efforts to engage with lawmakers and the public were dramatically expanded as Fed officials came to realize the traditional playbook of letting the Fed\'s actions and occasional public statements or congressional testimony speak for itself was not going to address the very real perception issues with the Fed\'s moves.\r\nA Washington operator\r\nPowell has continued, and expanded on, that communications effort since he became chairman in 2017. Lawmakers and aides on Capitol Hill say they\'ve found him accessible and blunt -- and in the words of one senator \"particularly helpful\" in framing the needed response to an unprecedented economic crisis.\r\nIt was Powell, in a March 17 private call with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who made the point that after two back-to-back emergency cuts that took interest rates to nearly zero, Congress was \"enabled to fiscally think big\" as it crafted its emergency economic response to coronavirus, according to a senior Democratic aide familiar with the call. Pelosi urged Powell to explore ways the Fed could aid states and localities during that same call.\r\nBy the time the final emergency rescue package was put together, it was both big -- at $2.2 trillion it marked the largest economic rescue package in US history -- and explicitly directed the Fed to use financial backing to create a facility to aid states and localities.\r\nWhile the Fed\'s economic power is unparalleled, its role in nearly every aspect of the current effort to rescue the economy is striking -- both in direct action or with regulatory moves to assist other elements.

It\'s these compounds that science links with positive effects in reducing the risk of several diseases.\"\r\nSome of the compounds commonly found in coffee \"have been related to better insulin sensitivity, liver function and reduced chronic inflammation,\" said V. Wendy Setiawan, an associate professor of preventive medicine at the Keck School of Medicine of USC, and the lead author of one of the recent studies on coffee consumption and longevity.\r\n\"Current evidence suggests that consuming moderate amounts of caffeine up to 200 mg per day, the amount in a 12-ounce cup of coffee, is not associated with increased risks for miscarriage or preterm birth,\" said Dr. Joseph Wax, chair of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists\' Committee on Obstetric Practice. \"However, data are contradictory regarding these pregnancy outcomes when women consume more than 200 mg per day of caffeine.\" Additionally, \"there is insufficient evidence to draw any conclusion regarding the effects of caffeine on fetal growth.\"\r\nIf you have any heart conditions, you should also limit your coffee and caffeine consumption. \"Caffeine is an aggravator and accelerator of one\'s heart rate,\" said Dr. Vince Bufalino, a spokesman for the American Heart Association and senior vice president and senior medical director of Cardiology-AMG, Advocate Health Care, in Naperville, Illinois. \"Those with atrial fibrillation (commonly known as irregular heartbeat) or hypertension should limit their caffeine intake. One to two cups daily is probably fine, but if you are sensitive, you should restrict all caffeine.\"\r\nKeep in mind that decaffeinated coffee still contains caffeine. An 8-ounce cup of brewed coffee can contain anywhere from 75 to 165 milligrams of caffeine, whereas decaffeinated coffee contains an average of 2 to 7 milligrams per cup, depending on which study you read.\r\n\"Decaf is not \'no-caf\' -- so if you are drinking three cups of decaf per day, then I would restrict that,\" Bufalino said of people with heart conditions.\r\nAs for coffee\'s effects on bone health, caffeine in coffee can lead to calcium loss, but it is probably not worth worrying about. \"Caffeine does increase urinary calcium loss, but it is balanced by increased calcium absorption so there seems to be no adverse effects on the calcium economy,\" said Connie Weaver, distinguished professor of nutrition science at Purdue University, who recently led a review of the research on calcium and bone health.
